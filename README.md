# Creating interactive maps with Folium. 

This repository works through an assignment for Programming for GIS. This assignment walks us through creating a chloropleth map for LA county zip codes based on the number of Starbucks present in each zip code. the final output also contains a precise map of all Strabucks locations in LA County. 

This lab uses Pandas dataframe to combine different parts of datasets to create an interactive map. 

For the chloropleth maps, we use a .csv and two .geojson files containing detials about the locations of the starbucks.

We belive that using zipcodes for chloropleth maps is a bad idea as zip codes do not display a lot of information except for they are useful in delivering mail and mail routes. For the final output we stick to addresses and exact locations and create a map that shows the distribution of Strabucks in LA. 

As a bonus map, we created a chloropleth map depicting its best usage. We created a map displaying the unemployment rate for every state in the US. Chloropleth is best when used for appropriate geographies.
